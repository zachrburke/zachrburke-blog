Hi, I'm Zach, a software/product engineer at a company called
[kaizen.io](https://kaizen.io) that is based out of Dallas, TX.

Professionally, I spend my day speaking with users, collating problems, then
resolving them with a mixed toolset that usually involves .NET, redis, some
flavor of SQL (psql or mssql), and possibly some kind of queuing system if
redis isn't good enough or available.

In my personal time, I'm learning rust by building a 2D pickleball simulator
with the game engine [bevy](https://bevy.org/).  This has transformed from a
learning project to something of a passion project, and I am very excited by
it.

I also like to nerd out about transit, collect vinyl records, and absolutely love JRPGs.

Feel free to shout any questions my way at my
